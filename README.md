# Linear Regression to Predict MPG

	The variables which provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in our dataset would be vehicle_length and ground_clearance.
In addition, the slope of the linear model is not zero. This is because the variables in our model have a correlation with fuel efficiency. This linear model can successfully predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes, as the model has an R-squared value of around 0.6825 which in turn means that the model can predict 68.25% of the non-random variation with the variables weâ€™ve used.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

       As shown in the Figure below, the variance of the PSI of the suspension coils is approximately 62.30, therefore the manufacturing data should meet the design specifications (Figure 1). We can conclude this for all lots asides from Lot3. This is because the variances of the other lots when compared to Lot 3 are quite low.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils 

       As shown in our one-sample t-tests, it is proven that Lot 3 is the sole lot with a mean differing from 1500. The figure below displays the t-test for Lot 3 (Figure 2). The calculated p-value was 0.04168, which is less than 0.05, therefore meaning that the alternative hypothesis that the two means are statistically different is correct.
